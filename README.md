# Prediction and Forecast of Sports Events using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains an advanced machine learning project that employs various algorithms to predict and forecast the outcomes of football matches. The project was developed in Python and relies on data from the [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) on Kaggle, which is presented in an SQLite database.

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Least Mean Squares Algorithm**: 
The Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm is used to implement a discriminant function for each betting company. The goal is to identify the betting company whose forecasts lead to the highest classification accuracy.

2. **Least Squares Algorithm**: 
The Least Squares (LS) algorithm is used to implement a discriminant function for each betting company. Again, the aim is to identify the betting company whose predictions yield the highest classification accuracy.

3. **Multilayer Neural Network**: 
A multilayer neural network is used to implement a discriminant function of the form that corresponds to the complete feature vector of each match.

In addition, the project employs 10-fold cross-validation to assess the accuracy of the classifiers during both training and testing phases.

Please note that while the original assignment was provided in Greek, all the code and comments in this repository are in English to make it more accessible to a global audience.
